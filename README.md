# Sorting Band Names Without Articles

---

## The "Sorting Band Names Without Articles" project is a coding challenge created by Wes Bos as part of his 30-day coding challenge series. The goal of the project is to create a JavaScript function that takes an array of band names as input and returns a new array with the band names sorted alphabetically, without taking into account any articles (i.e. "the", "a", or "an") at the beginning of the name.

To complete the challenge, the function must use JavaScript's built-in Array.prototype.sort() method to sort the band names alphabetically, and then use a regular expression to remove any articles from the beginning of the names. The function should then return the new, sorted array.

The challenge is designed to test the coder's understanding of JavaScript arrays, regular expressions, and sorting algorithms, and is a fun and practical way to improve your coding skills.
